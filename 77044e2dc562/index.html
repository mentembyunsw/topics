      Some critical thinking techniques    </header>
    <main>
      <p>Here are six simple but effective techniques to help your critical thinking.</p>
<h1>Check that you understand</h1>
<p>It's surprisingly common for us to misunderstand what people say, and this can lead us astray.</p>
<p>There are two main causes of misunderstanding. The first is <strong>obscurity</strong> - saying things in an unclear or overly complicated way. This has become common in business. It's also common when people try to sound deep or profound, especially when they don’t really have much to say. And it's common when people are deliberately obscure to avoid clearly answering a question (as politicians often are). People can also get caught up in a bunch of technical jargon, and forget how hard it is for non-experts to understand - a phenomenon known as &quot;the curse of knowledge&quot;.</p>
<p>The second main cause of misunderstanding is <strong>ambiguity</strong> - saying things that can be understood in more than one way. Suppose your friend says, &quot;I saw a man with binoculars&quot;. This can be understood in at least two ways. Your friend might be saying that she saw a man who had binoculars. Or, she might be saying that she used binoculars to see a man. These are different things, and they might differ in their truth. So you should clarify which of these she means.</p>
<p>It’s okay to tell people that you don’t understand what they're saying. In fact, it's a good idea. Checking that you understand, and being honest about it when you don’t, is part of good critical thinking.</p>
<p>How do you check that you understand? A good technique is to repeat what's been said, clearly and unambiguously and in your own words. It must be clear and unambiguous - if what you say is still obscure or ambiguous then you can’t be sure that you understand. And it must be in your own words - merely repeating the same words is not a good test of your understanding. See if you can say it in a way that the speaker herself wishes she had said it.</p>
<h1>Test against what you know</h1>
<p>A simple way to check the truth of what someone says is to test it against what you know. If you know it's true, then you can accept it. If you know it's false, then you should object to it.</p>
<p>Suppose someone says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>French is an official language of Switzerland</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You probably know that this is true; if so, you can accept it.</p>
<p>Suppose instead that someone says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>French is an official language of New Zealand</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You probably know that this is false; if so, you should object to it.</p>
<h1>See if you can easily find out</h1>
<p>In many cases you won’t know whether a claim is true or false. You probably don’t know, for example, whether:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boise is the capital city of Idaho</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In such cases you can’t evaluate the claim simply by testing against what you know. But you can easily find out, by searching online. Don't be afraid to say something like, &quot;Pause, let's check that before moving on&quot;, especially if you're faced with a claim that matters. You need to be a bit careful, because you need a source you can trust. (By the way, it's true.)</p>
<h1>Do a calculation</h1>
<p>Suppose someone claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all the Australian capital cities, Melbourne has the longest name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can easily check this, by doing a quick calculation: list the names of the Australian capital cities, count the number of letters in each, and see whether &quot;Melbourne&quot; is the longest. (Is it?)</p>
<p>That's a fairly easy calculation. Here's a harder one, but one you can still probably do. Suppose someone claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sydney-siders smoked a total of 183 billion cigarettes in 2015</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this true? Let's see. In 2015 there were about 5 million people in Sydney (a quick search shows this). If Sydney-siders smoked a total of 183 billion cigarettes in 2015, that would be about 36,000 cigarettes each (183 billion divided by 5 million is about 36,000). That’s about 100 cigarettes per day, each (36,000 divided by 365 is about 100). Not even a heavy smoker would smoke that many in one day, let alone every single person in Sydney. So there’s no way that this claim is true.</p>
<p>Doing calculations like this can be a very powerful way to check the truth of things.</p>
<h1>Look for a counterexample</h1>
<p>Suppose someone claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All Australian capital cities have &quot;d&quot; in their name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what we call a <strong>universal</strong> claim - a claim about everything of a certain kind.</p>
<p>The claim is false, and we can fairly easily see that it's false, by thinking of an Australian capital city whose name does not contain &quot;d&quot; (Perth, for example). Such a city shows that the universal is false. We call it a <strong>counterexample</strong> to the universal. So Perth is a counterexample to the universal that all Australian capital cities have &quot;d&quot; in their name.</p>
<p>We only need a single counterexample to see that a universal is false. As a matter of fact, there are multiple counterexamples to this particular universal – multiple Australian capital cities whose name does not contain &quot;d&quot; (can you think of another one?). Nevertheless, we only need one.</p>
<p>It can be very difficult to check whether a universal is <em>true</em>. Consider this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name of every US state contains at least four letters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This universal is true, but to see that it's true we need to check the name of <em>every</em> US state. It's not good enough to check just some of them, and note that their names contain at least four letters. We must check <em>every</em> state, and that takes a bit of work.</p>
<h1>Look for a confirming instance</h1>
<p>Suppose someone claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some US states have a name that starts with &quot;T&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is called an <strong>existential claim</strong> - a claim that there exists something of a certain kind. In this case, it's the claim that there exists a US state whose name starts with &quot;T&quot;.</p>
<p>This claim is true, and we can fairly easily see that it's true, by thinking of a US state whose name starts with &quot;T&quot; (Texas, for example). Such a state shows that the existential is true. We call it a <strong>confirming instance</strong> of the existential. So Texas is a confirming instance of the existential that some US states have a name that starts with &quot;T&quot;.</p>
<p>We only need a single confirming instance to see that an existential is true. As a matter of fact, there is another confirming instance of this particular existential – another US state whose name starts with &quot;T&quot; (do you know which one?). Nevertheless, we only need one.</p>
<p>Checking whether an existential is <em>false</em> is often quite difficult. Consider this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some US states have a name that starts with &quot;B&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This existential is false, but to see that it's false you need to check the name of <em>every</em> US state. It is not good enough to check just some of them, and note that none of them have a name that starts with &quot;B&quot; – you must check <em>every</em> state, and that takes a bit of work.</p>

<p>True or false? Cherophobia is the fear of being tickled.</p>
</summary>
<p>False. It's the fear of being happy. The fear of being tickled is called &quot;Gargalaphobia&quot;.</p>

<p>True or false? Among the days of the week, Saturday has the longest name.</p>
</summary>
<p>False. It's Wednesday.</p>

<p>True or false? The average person takes about two million breaths per year.</p>
</summary>
<p>It seems to be false. The average person takes about 15 breaths per minute (you can check online). That's 15 x 60 = 900 per hour. Which is 900 x 24 = 21,600 per day. Which is 21,600 x 365 = 7,884,000 per year. Which is quite a bit more than 2 million.</p>
<p>You could work backwards too. 2,000,000 per year is 2,000,000/365 = 5480 per day. Which is 5480/24 = 230 per hour. Which is 230/60 = 3.8 per minute. That's too small to be correct (try taking 4 breaths per minute).</p>
