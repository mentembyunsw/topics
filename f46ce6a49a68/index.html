      Presentations: Tuning-in    </header>
    <main>
      <p>In this topic, we will focus on the planning stages of your presentation. To do this we will review three aspects of a presentation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Presence</li>
<li>Occasion </li>
<li>Address</li>
</ol>
<h1>The art of listening</h1>
<p>Elizabethan playwright William Shakespeare knew it, and so did the Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. And so did your favourite high school teacher, the person who sold you your new TV, your sports coach and your even your GP!</p>
<p>You don’t have to be a ground-breaking wordsmith to know it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Most speaking situations have persuasive intentions, even if the speaker is not wholly conscious of them.&quot; (McCarthy &amp; Hatcher Presentation Skills 2011 ‘Getting to Know Your Listeners: 2')</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, experts tell us that <strong>persuasive speaking begins with good listening</strong>. Think about the last social event you went to. Was there someone who dominated the conversation? Did they fill the room with noise without first taking the time to listen?</p>
<p>It can be frustrating when people don't make space to actively ‘listen’ to people aroundd them. Don’t be that person! </p>
<p><strong>Listen first, then talk.</strong></p>
<h1>Plotting your course</h1>
<p>In this course, listening  means doing your homework. Anticipate who you will be speaking to and also why you are speaking to them. You can think of this as a formula between presence, occasion and address. These three aspects of a presentation should form the backbone of your opening.</p>
<p>A focus on presence, occasion and address is a little like plotting coordinates on a journey. You have known elements and an anticipated arrival point, along with a few assumptions that all inform the most effective course ahead. </p>
<p>Doing your background homework helps you ‘tune in’ to the room so that you understand what you uniquely bring to the conversation. It also helps you to make informed decisions about how you convince your audience that you have what they need.</p>
<p>The following three sections of this topic will be focused on providing an overview of presence, occasion and address</p>
<h1>1. Presence</h1>
<p>Listen to the following audio that provides an overview of how you can incoporate presence into your opening.</p>
<audio src="26f0f1919a14.mp3" controls></audio>
<p><strong>Who is speaking?</strong></p>
<p>To determine your presence, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is unique about me in this space?</li>
<li>How does my worldview (my background, experiences, knowledge and skillset) help my workplace see or be itself in new ways? </li>
<li>What specific ‘lens’ do I bring to problem solving in this context? </li>
<li>What is my value-add? </li>
</ul>
<p>You might also consider what assumptions you communicate about yourself before you even speak. For example, you may (sometimes without realising it) communicate your:</p>
<ul>
<li>professional level of experience</li>
<li>known/perceived skills or limitations</li>
<li>gender</li>
<li>cultural background</li>
<li>age.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also think about any ‘soft’ skills or aspects that inform your outlook. These might be things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>hobbies</li>
<li>lifestyles</li>
<li>interests</li>
<li>life experiences </li>
<li>ambitions. </li>
</ul>
<p>While these might not become a big part of your presentation, you can use them to inform your persuasive strategies  to connect with your audience – so don’t discount them just yet!</p>
<p><strong>Think about your own presence</strong></p>
<p>Think about a project that you are working on. Then, consider what you have read about presence and write down three sentences about yourself that inform your unique approach to the project or the lens that you will use to view the project. </p>
<p>And here’s the tricky part, you need to really believe what you write down here. The more specific you are, the more authentic you will feel and seem!</p>
<h1>2. Occasion</h1>
<p>Listen to the following audio that provides an overview of how you can incoporate occasion into your opening.</p>
<audio src="81ed573120ab.mp3" controls></audio>
<p><strong>Why are you speaking</strong></p>
<p>We all know the basic ‘why’ of your presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>you’ve been selected to identify areas of inefficiency in business processes </li>
<li>to design solutions for these inefficiencies</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, you are still working your way through that research, and you won’t have all of the answers to your proposed improvements just yet. But you will have enough to start preparing your approach. </p>
<p>This involves realising that the basic ‘why’ of you presentation is not the real ‘why’. To understand the real 'why', begin by asking yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the stakes of success in this space? </li>
<li>What would failure alternatively look like? </li>
<li>Why does the organisation need my model? (be specific) </li>
<li>Where does your unique ‘lens’ fit in to your model? </li>
</ul>
<p>Then, you need to identify how your proposal offers insight into a need that the business may not yet have recognised. To do this, your presentation should aim to do two things: </p>
<ol>
<li>Show that you have identified an area that is critical to making things better.</li>
<li>Make the case that improving this area is vital to the organisation as a whole.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How should you begin?</strong></p>
<p>Any good presentation begins by telling the audience why they need to be there. In other words, any good presentation is a response to some form of perceived need: A social need, a commercial need, or a material need. </p>
<p>Addressing the why is different from beginning by introducing what your presentation is about.</p>
<p>Consider these two different speech openers and decide what you think the audience can expect from each. When you have decided, reveal the answer for each speech opener. </p>
<ol>
<li>“In today’s presentation, I’m going to tell you how we can make better tin cans.”</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Reveal answer</p>
</summary>
<p>From this opener the audience might expect to be informed about a process that improves the quality of cans being produced, but they don’t know why or what for. Unless the audience is really interested in tin cans, you would have lost them at the beginning.</p>
</details>
<ol start="2">
<li>“In today’s presentation, I’m going to share with you the secret to the company’s longevity – and it begins by making better tin cans.”  </li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Reveal answer</p>
</summary>
<p>From this opener, the audience is cued to expect an insight about something that is important to the company’s future, in this case, ‘longevity’. The solution for the problem is the process of making tin cans. By connecting the solution to a problem, the audience understands why they are being asked to pay attention.</p>
</details>
<p>The real ‘why’ of any business presentation is not simply sharing the information you have gathered. It is certainly not a data dump. And nor is it a technical manifesto. It is a strategic vision that is predictive of a key part of the company’s future outlook. And for that to resonate you need to situate your solution within the context of the company’s immediate concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Think about your own occasion</strong></p>
<p>Take some time now to write down three sentences that sum up your occasion.</p>
<ul>
<li>How does your identified problem area demonstrate what you understand about the company’s core concerns?</li>
<li>How does your identified problem relate to the company's vision moving forward? </li>
</ul>
<p>The subtext of your approach to ‘occasion’ should be something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I am here to tell you that I have the key to a vision you didn’t necessarily know you had.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>3. Address</h1>
<p>Listen to the following audio that provides an overview of how you can incoporate address into your opening.</p>
<audio src="e03ba749e973.mp3" controls></audio>
<p><strong>Who are you speaking to?</strong></p>
<p>Do your research - who will be in the presentation room? </p>
<p>Consider the criteria you used to consider your own presence and apply it to your audience. Are there any crossovers between your and their:</p>
<ul>
<li>experience </li>
<li>skillset </li>
<li>background </li>
<li>hobbies </li>
<li>shared interests?</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid making vague assumptions about your audience - guesswork can backfire. Instead, you should consider a range of variables and start with the aspects you do know. Ask yourself these questions as you consider your audience:</p>
<ul>
<li>What preconceptions might your audience bring to the table </li>
<li>Are you attempting to shif their perceptions? If so, how much?</li>
<li>What criteria for success will they be using to evaluate your proposal?</li>
<li>What aspects of your proposal might ring alarm bells or make your audience feel sceptical? </li>
<li>What aspects might command your authority of vision to them?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Think about your own address</strong></p>
<p>Take some time now to write down three sentences that sum up your address, in view of what assumptions and expectations your audience bring to this moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is this an opportunity for? </li>
<li>Will you be driving or changing the conversation?</li>
<li>Will you be taking the converstaion to new directions? If so, why? If not, why not?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Locate your zinger!</h2>
<p><strong>Call to action</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is it that you want your audience to do by the close of your presentation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listen to the audio to get a better understanding of incoporating a call to action in your presentation.</p>
<audio src="91272bfe8b26.mp3" controls></audio>
<p><strong>Persuasion</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you want your audience to understand, feel and be moved to do by the end of your presentation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you prepare for your presentation use the following template as a guide to determine what you want to persuade your audience to:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand</li>
<li>feel</li>
<li>be moved to do. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fill the blanks in the following statemetns as relevant to your specific context:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want my audience to understand ....... about.......</li>
<li>I want my audience to feel .......about .......</li>
<li>I want my audience to be moved to ....... because .......</li>
</ol>
<h2>Knowledge check</h2>
<p>Each statements numbered 1 - 3 corresponds to one of the following categories: </p>
<ul>
<li>Presence: Who is speaking</li>
<li>Occasion: Why you are speaking</li>
<li>Address: To whom you are speaking</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the statements and decide which category it corresponds to before reavealing the answer for each. </p>
<details>

<p>Occasion: Why you are speaking</p>
</details>

<summary>
<p>2: Avoid making vague assumptions about your audience as guesswork can backfire.</p>
</summary>
<p>Address: To whom you are speaking</p>
