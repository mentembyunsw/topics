      Presentations: Structuring Ideas    </header>
    <main>
      <p>In this topic, we will focus on structuring templates that will aid the organisation of complex information into logical, meaningful and memorable sequences.</p>
<h1>What is a great structure?</h1>
<p>You might have the best idea in the world, and the most persuasive information to convey it, but unless you effectively structure your presentation, your proposal will be over before it has even begun.</p>
<p>All speaking situations have persuasive intentions. All reasoned arguments have an intrinsic shape that, whether encapsulated in a three-minute elevator pitch or a 20 minute detailed presentation, explains in a nutshell the ‘why’, the ’how’, and the ‘what-for’ of the speech being presented.</p>
<p>School students tend to learn that the argumentative strategies of persuasive speech take the following triptych shape and each stage is described in the paragraphs below. </p>
<div class="stage small">Introduction</div>
<div class="stage large">Body of argument</div>
<div class="stage small">Conclusion</div>
<style>
  div.stage {display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; font-size: 150%; border-radius: 100%}
  div.stage.small {width: 7em; height: 7em; line-height: 7em; background-color:rgba(147,112,219,0.15)}
  div.stage.large {width: 14em; height: 14em; line-height: 14em; background-color:rgba(147,112,219,0.7)}
</style>
<h1>Introduction: The why</h1>
<p><strong>15% of speaking time</strong></p>
<p>Here you introduce the ‘why’ of the problem, and why the audience should want it solved. You also implicitly detail why you are the person to solve it. </p>
<p>Grip the audience. Hook them by engaging them in a humorous or moving situation, conundrum or story. Invite them to ‘picture this’. Take them into the future or the past. Hit them with a killer number or fact. Try to appeal to a combination of pathos and logos – but also be succinct!</p>
<p>In the presentation we reviewed in the previous topic by Jennifer Granholm, she offers an excellent example of an opener that addresses all ‘whys’ here by appealing most to logos and ethos.</p>
<h1>Body of argument: From why to how</h1>
<p><strong>70% of speaking time</strong></p>
<p>This is where you showcase key points of detail in the driving idea. Consider this as a narrative that is supported by facts and evidence-based solutions. Also remember that your aim is to persuade your listeners by being clear. Avoid bombarding them with every possible piece of information, instead, edit for the most compelling account.</p>
<p>There are various ways to sequence this section. Here is an example of what it could look like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Before to After</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Before’ relates to the problem, anecdote conveying problem and evidence. ‘After’ relates to a solution, evidence conveying solution and story conveying solution. </p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Story of Process</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>This relates to a sequential narrative of the business process that showcases trouble spots and then narrates alternative solutions. Note that this is not a narrative of your research process!</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Lenses of impact</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In this section, the problem and solution are conveyed three times as anecdotes and evidence. But they move from personal or local accounts to institutional or global impacts and then solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Five reasons why</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>This section leads by showcasing reasons why your solution needs to be actioned and then backs those up with evidence and examples. Reasons must span different areas of the business that is impacted or affected. For example, reasons will relate to staff, customers, shareholders, or different departments within the business operation itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Conclusion: The what-for</h1>
<p><strong>15% of speaking time</strong></p>
<p>Bring it home.</p>
<p>Restate what you are envisioning and the ‘why’ of your presentation. If it doesn’t happen, what will things look like instead?</p>
<p>Remind the audience why it is the most pressing, most unique or most innovative vision.</p>
<p>Call to action: Tell your audience what you want them to do next.</p>
<h1>Let's analyse an example</h1>
<p>In the following comical presentation, ‘How to Sound Smart in your TED Talk’ by Will Stephen, the speaker demonstrates an effective and persuasive speech structure by satirising the conventions of good presentation skills. At the same time, the satire produces a very clear account of how persuasive bodies move, compelling speakers talk and informative slides work to create great presentations. </p>
<p>As you watch the video, notice as Will moves through the following sections in his talk: </p>
<ol>
<li>Starting with an opening question</li>
<li>How to use a personal anecdote</li>
<li>Bringing the personal to a broader point (local, then global)</li>
<li>Facts and evidence (logos and pathos)</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>

<h1>Over to you</h1>
<p>Spend time brainstorming and plotting your speech. Here is a template you can use:</p>
<p><a href="2fe8d049a280.docx">Download a template</a></p>
<p>Look back over all of the 9 topics you have completed in this course and collate your ideas. </p>
<ul>
<li>What is your driving concept? </li>
<li>Where can the different kinds of information that you have sourced to date, sit? </li>
<li>How can you situate yourself most novelly, most compellingly? </li>
<li>What do you specifically have to offer?</li>
