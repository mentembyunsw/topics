%% Presentations: the basics %%

The objective of the upcoming modules is to get you thinking about, and practicing, how you can be a better presenter. Not only will you have the opportunity to apply your improved presentation skills in your immediate work context, but you will also draw upon examples that are broader than work. These contexts might range from giving a wedding speech to, for instance, to mobilising your local sports club into collective action.

The foundation of these modules is authenticity, which is the first and foremost key to developing your skills in speaking persuasively. To find your authentic voice you will be identifying with what you feel most connected to.

# Authentic storytelling

We all know how it feels to be an audience member listening to a boring presentation.

- Your fingers itch to pull out your phone. 
- Your eyes drift to the blue sky outside. 
- You have to work hard to stop yourself nodding off to sleep. 

It is not uncommon to be squirming in empathy with the speaker as try to engage the audience. But,  unfortunately for the presentter, the contemporary world is time-pressured and full of competing distractions. Our minds are increasingly trained to not process complex information. 

This means that we want information that is: Faster, clearer and cleaner.

# Distractions

In today's day and age, we are used to thinking in multiple channels. 

Look around you:
- How many screens do you have open right now? 
- How many devices are you using?

As presenters, we have to work hard to cut through the noise in order to get our point across. At the same time, public communication is more vital than ever. Here are a few core components to building human connections: 
- communicating with spoken rather than printed words
- using physical presence, facial expressions and addressing other people in a shared space 
- being familiar with communicating in physical and virtual environments.

If we do these things well, we will be better able to form judgements, evaluate propositions and process knowledge.

# Let's look at some examples

Although the world is becoming increasingly digital, nothing can replace how authentic storytelling connects us to: 
- ideas
- causes 
- values. 

Let's look at three examples of astounding public speeches to have addressed our world stage in recent times. As you watch the following three videos consider the follwoing questions:
1. What strategies have these speakers use to connect with their audience?
2. How you can can learn from these speakers and their speeches?
3. What secrets of success to these speakers hold?

# 1. A young leader

In recent times, we have seen young people address world leaders with high levels of impact. Watch this video in which Greta Thunberg gives a speech to world leaders at UN Climate Action Summit.

# 2. A celebrity
Celebrities have also used spoken communication platforms to call ‘time’s up’ on key issues. Watch this video in which Oprah Winfrey gives a heartfelt speech as the recipient of the Cecil B. deMille Award at the 2018 Golden Globes.

# 3. A politician
Politicians have also used the stage to mobilise action in new directions. Watch this video in which Barack Obama took the stage to deliver the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in Boston in 2004. A speech that some have referred to as the speech that made him president.
