# Data volumes

We'll be talking a lot about data volume as well. So it's worth clarifying the units that are used to measure volumes of data. The numbers involved can get very large. To help grasp what they mean, we've converted each unit into a more meaningful approximate equivalent.

## bit (b)

A bit is either 0 or 1. When data is stored digitally it is ultimately stored as a sequence of 0s and 1s.

## byte (B)

A byte is 8 bits. Since each bit can have one of two values (0 or 1), a byte can hold $2^8$ = 256 different values, which is enough different combinations for us to use one byte to store one character.

## kilobyte (kB)

A kilobyte is 1000 bytes. (Sometimes "kilobyte" is used to mean $2^{10}$ = 1024 bytes, but it is recommended that we use "kibibyte" for that.) A kilobyte is about a paragraph of text (a typical paragraph has about 1000 characters).

## megabyte (MB)

A megabyte is 1000 kilobytes. (A "mebibyte" is 1024 kibibytes.) A megabyte is about a large book of text (a typical large books has about 1000 paragraphs - about 3 per page, for about 333 pages).

## gigabyte (GB)

A gigabyte is 1000 megabytes. (A "gibibyte" is 1024 mebibytes.) A gigabyte is about a small bookshop of text (a typical small bookshop has about 1000 books).

## terabyte (TB)

A terabyte is 1000 gigabytes. (A "tebibyte" is 1024 gibibytes.) A terabyte is about a university library of text (a typical university library has about 1000 small bookshops of books).

## petabyte (PB)

A petabyte is 1000 terabytes. (A "pebibyte" is 1024 tebibytes.) A petabyte is roughly the amount of text in all the books in Australia (about 1000 libraries worth).
