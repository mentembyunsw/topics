%% Respecting data ownership %%

Like many things, data can be owned. And when it's owned, you need the owner's permission to use it. So, if there's some data you'd like to use, and the data is owned, and it's not owned by you, then you need to first get the owner's permission.

Before discussing how to get permission, we need to clarify a few things about data ownership.

# What's owned

Suppose you go to the local park, and collect some data about its trees - their species and heights. This data is yours - you own it.

Suppose that the next day someone else does the same thing - goes to the park and collects data about the species and heights of the trees. Have they violated your ownership? Did they need your permission to do this?

No. What you own is the *data* you collected, which is a set of measurements. You don't own the *facts* that you measured.

The other person hasn't used your data. They've made their own measurements of the facts, to collect their own data. That doesn't require your permission, because you don't own those facts. You *do* own the data you collected - the measurements you made - so they would need your permission to use them. But they don't need your permission to collect their own data about those same facts.

# Who owns it

Notice that in the case above, it's not the trees that own the data, even though it's data about them. It's *you* who owns the data, because you're the one who collected it.

That's a clear case, because trees are inanimate objects. Things are murkier when we're collecting data about people.

Suppose you go to the local supermarket and collect data about shoppers - their girths and heights. This is more complicated than the tree case, in at least two ways.

First, you need a customer's permission to measure these things - you can't just measure their girth and height without asking.

Second, who owns the data in this case - you, or the customer? It's still you, because you're the one making and collecting the measurements. So, it's your data. It's not the customer's data, even though it's about them.

That said, owning the data doesn't give you the right to do whatever you want with it - you have an obligation to the customers to use it responsibly. So, you can't just publish the data wherever you want, or show it to whomever you want. Because of this, customers might be reluctant to let you collect the data - they'd be trusting you to use it responsibly. But if they do give permission, then the data is yours.

To summarise. Collecting data about people requires the permission of those people. Once that permission is granted, the data belongs to whomever collects it. But the owner still has an obligation to those people to use the data responsibly.

# What owners can do

The owner of some data has quite a lot of power over it. They can grant permission to use the data. They can grant permission to grant permission to use the data (i.e. delegate their authority to grant permission). They can even transfer the ownership of the data to someone else.

But, and this is important, if the data is about people then they must use the data responsibly. If the owner cannot be trusted to use the data responsibly, then people will be reluctant to give their permission for the data to be collected in the first place.

Part of using the data responsibly means being careful about who's permitted to use the data. A responsible data owner will be very cautious about giving this permission. So, you can expect it to be difficult to get this permission sometimes (for good reason).

# Getting permission

Much of the time, the data you'd like to use is owned by one of the following:

- Your organisation
- The government, who are making it available at their website
- An individual, who's making it available via an online repository (such as Kaggle or GitHub)

If it's owned by your organisation, there'll be someone in the organisation with authority to grant permission to use it. You'll need to find that person and get permission.

If it's owned by the government, and is being made available at their website, then you're likely to automatically have permission to use it. But you should check whether there are any special conditions.

If it's owned by an individual, who's making it available via an online repository, then you're likely to have permission to use it, but there might well be special conditions attached. The data will probably have a licence, which specifies any such special conditions - you should check that licence, and follow it.

Keep in mind that having permission to use some data doesn't mean that you can do whatever you want with it. You need to be aware of what your responsibilities are, and to uphold them.

# Check your understanding

[[[ Q1. Suppose you count and record the number of birds in a local park. Who owns the resulting data? >>>
You do - you're the one creating the data.
]]]

[[[ Q2. Suppose someone else also counts and records the number of birds in the park. Who owns that data? >>>
That person does - they're the one creating that data. Even though their data is about the same things as your data, it's still their data.
]]]

[[[ Q3. Suppose you count and record the number of people in the park, instead of birds. Who owns the resulting data? >>>
Still you - you're still the one creating the data. Even though it's data about people, they do not own the data. 
]]]

[[[ Q4. Do you need the permission of the people to count them? >>>
Probably not - your data does not include any personal information about them. 
]]]

[[[ Q5. What if you were recording their names and what they did in the park - would you need their permission in that case? >>>
Probably - your data would then include personal information. 
]]]

[[[ Q6. Suppose you get their permission. Can you then use your data in any way you like? >>>
No. Even though they've given you permission to *collect* the data, you still have a duty to respect their privacy and use the data with care.
