      Decision making: assessing your options    </header>
    <main>
      <p>Suppose you're making a decision, either alone or with the help of a group. The first two things you need to do are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the options, if they're not given to you;</li>
<li>Identify the pros and cons of each option.</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you do these two things?</p>
<h1>Identifying the options</h1>
<p>If the options aren't given to you, you need to identify them.</p>
<p>This is a creative process - you want to let your imagination run, and come up with a diverse range of options. This is not the time to be critical, or to rule anything out - that can happen in the next step. (Although, there's no point listing options that are clearly unviable.)  </p>
<p>If you're getting help from a group, it's good for them to be diverse and creative thinkers, and they should be encouraged to think divergently. Again, this is not the time to be critical - criticism of ideas can lead people to hold back, and be less creative. So you should be quick to stop people evaluating and criticising ideas at this stage.</p>
<p>To encourage creative thinking, you could start with a creative thinking exercise. Here's one such activity:</p>

<h1>Identifying their pros and cons</h1>
<p>Once you have the options, you need to identify their pros and cons.</p>
<p>For each option, you want to identify, as much as you can, the effects of choosing that option, both in the short and long term, and the extent to which those effects are good or bad.</p>
<p>This requires knowledge and experience. If you're working with a group, you want people to share their relevant knowledge and experience, especially if it's unique to them - if it's knowledge or experience they have but others in the group don't. You want people to feel comfortable sharing as much as they can.</p>
<p>It also requires critical thinking. What will happen if you choose a certain option? What effects will it have? To what extent are they good or bad? It can help to get people into a critical thinking state of mind by starting with a critical thinking exercise. Here's one such exercise:</p>

<h1>Two fallacies to be aware of</h1>
<p>When considering the pros and cons of options, it's good to be aware of two fallacies that we're prone to commit. Each can lead to an incorrect assessment of an option. </p>
<p><strong>The planning fallacy</strong>. We tend to underestimate how long a project will take. So beware of people's estimates. It's a good idea to find out how long similar projects have taken, and assume that your project will take just as long (which is likely). Using data in this way can help to make more realistic estimates.</p>
<p><strong>The sunk cost fallacy</strong>. We tend to grow irrationally attached to projects that we've spent money on. So be wary when you hear reasons such as, &quot;we've already spent so much money on this project that we can't stop now&quot;. This can lead to what's colloquially called, &quot;throwing good money after bad&quot;, and technically called &quot;the sunk cost fallacy&quot;. There's a technique that can help avoid committing this fallacy. Suppose you're inclined to keep pursuing a project, on the basis of how much you've spent so far. Ask the question, &quot;If we were offered this project as a gift now, would we take it?&quot;. If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, then you're likely to be committing the sunk cost fallacy.</p>
<h1>The danger of group think</h1>
<p>People in a group might be reluctant to share what they know, if it goes against the current mood of the group. And this can have dire consequences.</p>
<p>To illustrate, suppose that one of the options is looking attractive - it has many pros, and few cons. Suppose that you can see a problem for the option, one that hasn't yet been mentioned. It's important that you mention this problem, but you might be reluctant, for several reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>First</strong>, you might irritate others in the group. Having an option with many pros and few cons can make people in the group feel happy - it will make their final choice easier, and faster. If you mention your problem, people might not react to you well. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, you might get a reputation as being negative, or a nay-sayer, and not be given opportunities in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, you might decide that what you thought was a problem is not really a problem. After all, with so many pros and so few cons having been identified, perhaps you are mistaken?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, you might want to impress certain other people in the group, especially those in a position of power or influence, by agreeing with them, or at least not disagreeing with them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't share your perceived problem, and others in the group hold back too, it can lead to &quot;happy talk&quot; - an overly optimistic appraisal of the option. This, in turn, can lead people in the group to wrongly form an even more positive opinion of the option than they initially did, so they end up with an even more extreme and confident view of the option. This is bad.</p>
<p>So you, and the rest of the group, must go out of your way to make people feel comfortable with sharing what they know, even when it's negative.</p>
<p>In fact, <em>especially</em> when it's negative. Dissent, as it's called, can actually have a positive effect on a group, by stimulating more independent thinking. It doesn't matter whether the dissenters are right or wrong - either way, their dissent tends to cause the group to be more open-minded, more creative, and more rigorous in their weighing of pros and cons, all of which promote better decision making. Dissenters might not be persuasive, but they are influential. So the group should welcome dissent, not discourage or punish it.</p>
<p>A technique you might try is to appoint a devil's advocate, or multiple devil's advocates (who form what's called a &quot;red team&quot;), whose job is to actively look for problems, regardless of what their own opinions are. Such pretend dissent can be better than nothing, but it is not as good as genuine dissent.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that if you are forming a group to make a decision then you should include people who are likely to disagree, and you should encourage them to do so.</p>
<h1>Hear from a couple of experts</h1>
<p>In this short video, Adam Grant describes the benefits of dissent, especially genuine dissent:</p>

<p>And in this one, Cass Sunstein talks about the general perils of group decision making:</p>
