      Presentations: Projecting Confidence    </header>
    <main>
      <p>In this topic, we will focus on how choices in body posture, gesture and eye contact can project confidence and debug nerves.</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>We communicate not only through words, but through a range of unconscious and conscious body practices that can be called non-verbal communication. You are already highly trained in interpreting the embodied communication strategies of other people – even if you don’t realise that you are!  </p>
<p>More importantly, you probably don’t realise that whenever you are in an interpersonal exchange, you are never ‘not’ behaving. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as non-behaviour or, to put it even more simply, one cannot not behave. Now, if it is accepted that all behaviour in an interactional situation has message value, i.e. is communication, it follows that no matter how one may try, one cannot not communicate. Activity or inactivity, words or silence all have message value, they influence others and these others, in turn, cannot not respond to these communications. (McCarthy and Hatcher (2011) Presentations Skills, p. 4.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your approach to non-verbal communication can vastly enhance your persuasive strategies. This is because non-verbal communication expresses your confidence and importantly, your authenticity, as a speaker. When your audience feels ‘safe’ with you on the stage, your <strong>ethos</strong> is enhanced. They will trust you with their listening experience and hence trust your ideas. </p>
<p>In this topic we will focus on four aspects of non-verbal communication.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Posture</strong>. How you stand or sit. For example, whether your arms are crossed or shoulders are down</li>
<li><strong>Body movements</strong>. For example, hand gestures or nodding or shaking the head.</li>
<li><strong>Facial expressions</strong>. For example, smiling, frowning and even blinking.</li>
<li><strong>Eye contact</strong>. The amount of eye contact often determines the level of trust and trustworthiness of a speaker.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Watch and think</h1>
<p>Watch the first two minutes of this example of American-Syrian spoken word poet Amal Kassir. Try to watch it first <strong>without the sound or captions on</strong> and make notes on what you notice about her body movements and posture. </p>
<p>As you watch, consider the following questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Where is Kassir’s body most active or dynamic?</li>
<li>Where is Kassir’s body most static?</li>
<li>What kind of impression does Kassir create, even before you encounter her words or voice?</li>
</ul>

<h1>Watch again</h1>
<p>Now watch the clip again with the <strong>sound on</strong>.</p>
<p>Consider the following aspects of body language as you watch. Then, when you have finished watching, reveal the description of how Kassir uses body langauge to communicate a particular kind of message to see if you noticed the same things.</p>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Physical stance</p>
</summary>
<p>Legs together, gendered, demure, off-balance, non-threatening.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Arm gestures</p>
</summary>
<p>Energised from the waist upwards, signal openness, vulnerability, affectivity.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Face</p>
</summary>
<p>Expressive, warm, smiling.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Use of space</p>
</summary>
<p>Minimal (again, non-threatening, non-trespassing, common ground).</p>
</details>
<p>Kassir’s presentation is both moving and comical. It also seeks to deliver an important message about finding common ground across perceived cultural divides. </p>
<p>While she’s very charismatic she’s also breaking some of the rules you’ll need to employ in a business presentation context. While Kassir presents a deeply ‘authentic’ self, her demure posture and gestures detract from how her strength might be perceived. This doesn’t mean an audience won’t trust her – it just means they might not see her commanding a leadership role.</p>
<h1>Strike a power pose: Be grounded</h1>
<p>Kassir is doing the opposite of what researcher Amy Cuddy calls the ‘Power Speaking Pose’ in her 2012 Ted Talk entitled &quot;Your body language may shape who you are&quot;. Cuddy’s motivational concept ‘fake it till you make it’ puts biology into the psychology of success. It’s worth watching her TedX presentation to understand more about how this works. </p>
<p>Cuddy gives us the idea that body language not only communicates to others but communicates ideas about yourself to yourself. Cuddy argues that rehearsing different postures can change the chemistry inside your body, so that you actually start feeling more confident.</p>
<p>Just like Wonder Woman, power-speaking involves standing tall, with legs hip width apart. Wide legs (as opposed to Kassir’s compact legs) create balance and project the sense that the speaking person is grounded. Grounding yourself also helps to anchor your body so that you speak with a more diaphragmatic vocal projection and resonance.
Basically, standing tall and being grounded makes you seem, as well as feel, that you are in control of your message.</p>
<p>It is important to note that in a world of diverse bodies and abilities there are other ways of projecting groundedness and strength that do not only rely on standing tall. Comedian Stella Young achieved enormous success as a public speaker for her message as well as her charismatic stage presence.</p>

<h1>Find your power shape: Arms alive</h1>
<p>Kassir’s arms are very active. They energise her speech, they emphasise key points within it, while keeping the movement contained to a waist-height circle that does not distract the viewer away from her face nor dissipate energy down to the floor. </p>
<p>Kassir is here doing what experts in the book Talk Like TED by Carmine Gallo (2014) call the ‘gestural power sphere’. The 'gestural power sphere’ locates presentational ‘power’ in the upper body. To find it, the authors suggest you imagine: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A circle that runs from the top of your eyes out to the tips of your outstretched hands, down to your belly button, and back up to your eyes again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to keep your gestures (and eye gaze) in this zone. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hands that hang below your navel lack energy and “confidence”. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using complex gestures above the waist will give the audience a sense of confidence about you as a leader.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to what you might expect, audiences trust a speaker who uses gestures. This is because gestures signal our thinking processes. But it won’t work if you flap your arms about aimlessly and wildly, projecting a sense of loss of control. Instead, try to find a balance between stillness and movement with your hand gestures. If you tend towards nervousness, then keep your hands fixed on the lectern or slide clicker. But if you can trust your arms to stay within the power sphere, then allow them to animate and punctuate your presentation at particular intervals.</p>
<h1>Eye contact</h1>
<p>Eye contact can be the most terrifying aspect of public presentation. Why is this? Because it reminds you that you are being looked at. When you feel looked at, you feel as if your audience has an x-ray machine that can see straight inside to your weak spots, vulnerabilities and nervousness. Eye contact can be uncomfortable for many individuals and indeed, in some cultures eye contact is not an expected convention of good communication at all. If you would like to read a little more about what eye contact means in different cultures, visit:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brighthubeducation.com/social-studies-help/9626-learning-about-eye-contact-in-other-cultures/">Bright Hub article</a></p>
<p>In Western contexts, eye contact signals that you are interested in the person you are looking at. Showing that you acknowledge listeners in the room and seek to engage them in your ideas is absolutely essential to any good presentation in a Western communication setting.</p>
<h1>The Magic Number 5</h1>
<p>The article <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-maintain-good-eye-contact-3024392">&quot;How to Overcome Eye Contact Anxiety&quot;</a> by Arlin Cuncic (2021) reports on research that has shown that &quot;The Magic Number 5 of Eye Contact&quot;.</p>
<p>The article states that if you make eye contact</p>
<ol>
<li>People will be more likely to remember your face.</li>
<li>People will be more likely to remember what you said long after the conversation has ended.</li>
<li>People are more likely to believe what you're saying.</li>
<li>People will perceive you as more confident and intelligent.</li>
<li>People will be better able to read and mirror other non-verbal cues.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now watch the first minute of Kassir’s speech again and consider the following questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>What do you notice about where her gaze is directed? </li>
<li>What do you think she covers or connects with? </li>
<li>What areas do you think she misses or neglects? </li>
</ul>
<p>After you have watched, reveal the answer to see if you noticed the same things.</p>
<details>
<summary>
<p>Reveal the answer</p>
</summary>
<p>As you watched for a second time, you may have noticed that Kassir continuously moves her gaze across the seating bank to land on different points – presumably audience members – but notice that she never stays on one point for too long – this is her way of making everyone feel included. </p>
<p>Kassir also lifts her gaze to mid-point height, suggesting she reaches rows, and listeners, who are seated further back. This is also really important because it shows she acknowledges the scope and scale of the room.</p>
<p>Her head is, however, often bent down a little too demurely to signal complete command and confidence.</p>
</details>
<h1>Tips to help you make eye contact</h1>
<p>If you find the concept of making eye contact challenging, there are some techniques to help:</p>
<p><strong>See the many</strong>: Like Kassir, allow your gaze to work across the room, rather than focussing on one person only. This helps you feel centered, but also gives you a way to break the intensity of one-to-one contact while still engaging listeners. </p>
<p><strong>Look near the eyes</strong>: Kassir may be making direct eye contact, but the stage lighting might also prohibit that from happening in the space that she is in. Instead, we get a sense that she is looking close to but not directly at, audience members’ eyes. Focus on a spot close to a person’s eyes if direct eye contact is too challenging for you. Try to create a rhythm for yourself – 3 seconds is a good amount of time to hold your gaze before you move on.</p>
<p><strong>Take in the whole room</strong>: Be sure to take in the whole of the audience in the room – and you can do this by imagining a figure 5 cast across them. Trace with your eyes the shape of the 5. This will ensure you capture and engage the back of the room as well as those in front. It will also provide you with a task to follow rather than allowing your eyes to flit about or avoid contact nervously.</p>
<h1>Let's look at another example</h1>
<p>Take a look at another example in which Jennifer Granholm delivered ‘A Clean Energy Proposal’ in 2013. Watch the first minute of her speech, which is a great example of how all of the elements of persuasive speaking that we have been looking at so far can work together to create a unified ‘authentic’ whole. You might think of this ‘whole’ as personal brand.</p>
<p>As you watch, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you notice about how Granholm employs aspects of presence, occasion and address?</li>
<li>How does Granholm appeal to logos, ethos and pathos?</li>
<li>How are both supported by effective gestural and vocal choices?</li>
</ul>
<div style="max-width:854px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/jennifer_granholm_a_clean_energy_proposal_race_to_the_top" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>In the first minute alone, Granholm has established her credibility as a speaker and engaged listeners in the ‘why’ of her speaking – there is a ‘problem’ that she can solve – by evoking a story that brings the stakes of the data to life. Her rhetorical approach has been supported by strong vocal and physical choices that present her as a speaker who is in command of the vision they present.</p>
<p>Review how she uses vocal and physical cues for each of the following excepts. </p>

<h1>Practice and perfect your speech</h1>
<p>You can practice these physical strategies in refining posture, using gestures and making eye contact at home. You can also mark them up on your transcript as modelled in the table presented in the answer to the Jennifer Granholm task so that you know where you plan to emphasise a key section with a particular gesture. The key is to remain authentic to ‘you’ while also extending into stronger and clearer physical choices.</p>
