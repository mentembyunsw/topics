%% Thinking critically about reasons %%

# Humans and reasoning

Humans reason. We do it to figure things out, to justify ourselves, and to convince others. Our use of reason so struck the Greek philosopher Aristotle that he viewed it as our defining feature - one that sets us apart from all other animals.

Unfortunately, we're not great reasoners. Yes, we *can* do it well, and we've achieved some remarkable feats with the help of reasoning. But we also make systematic mistakes.

Part of the problem is that the environment in which we now live is quite different from the environment in which we evolved the ability to reason, and techniques that might have worked well back then often fail us now.

Another part of the problem is that we fail to realise that reasoning is best done socially, not in isolation. We are quick to find reasons that favour things we'd like to be true, or go against things we'd like to be false, and we hold them to relatively low standards when evaluating them. Conversely, we ignore reasons that go against things we'd like to be true, or favour things we'd like to be false, and hold them to higher standards. Because of this, we need others to assess our reasoning, especially people who want our conclusions not to be true - their biases can help to counteract our own.

Part of critical thinking is being able to assess the quality of reasoning. Is the reasoning good enough to think that the conclusion is true? There's a process you can follow to answer this question:

1. Identify the premise and the conclusion of the reasoning.
2. Check that the premise is true.
3. Check that the premise entails the conclusion.

This is all explained in the following three examples.

# First example

Suppose your friend believes there's no life anywhere else in our solar system. You ask her why, and she says, "Because no one has yet found any". In effect, she's giving you a piece of reasoning. It goes as follows:

> No one has yet found any life anywhere else in our solar system<br>
  Therefore,<br>
  There is no life anywhere else in our solar system

The reasoning has a **premise** and a **conclusion**. The premise is the claim that no one has yet found any life anywhere else in our solar system. The conclusion is the claim that there is no life anywhere else in our solar system. The premise is the reason that she's giving; the conclusion is what it’s a reason for. She's offering the premise as a reason to think that the conclusion is true.

We have presented the reasoning in the following form:

> Premise<br>
  Therefore,<br>
  Conclusion

This is called **standard form**. It's a nice way to present a piece of reasoning, because it shows clearly how the reasoning goes. Every piece of reasoning can be presented in this form.

The word "Therefore" is not part of the premise, and it's not part of the conclusion – it's there just to separate the two, and to indicate that some reasoning is being done.

How good is this particular piece of reasoning? Is it good enough to think that the conclusion is true?

For it to be good enough, two conditions must be satisfied:

- The premise is true
- The premise entails the conclusion

If both conditions are satisfied, then the reasoning is good enough to think that the conclusion is true. Otherwise, it's not good enough.

Let’s look at each condition, and see what it means.

The first condition is familiar. We understand what it means for the premise to be true.

Is this condition satisfied in this case? That is, is the premise true? Is it true that no one has yet found any life anywhere else in our solar system? Yes, it’s true. So in this case the first condition is satisfied – the premise is true.

What about the second condition? This one is not so familiar. What does it mean for the premise to entail the conclusion? It means this: if the premise is true then the conclusion *has* to be true – the conclusion could not be false. In other words, it’s *impossible* for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false.

Is this condition satisfied in this case? Let’s check, by asking ourselves: “If the premise is true, does the conclusion have to be true”? That is, “If no one has yet found any life anywhere else in our solar system, does it have to be true that there is no life anywhere else in our solar system”? And the answer to this question is, “No”. Even if no one has yet found any, that doesn’t mean there's no life anywhere else in our solar system – perhaps it’s there and we just haven’t found it yet. So in this case the second condition is not satisfied – the premise does not entail the conclusion.

Now let’s put these two conditions together. For the reasoning to be good enough for you to think that the conclusion is true (i.e. for you to think that there is no life anywhere else in our solar system) it must satisfy both of the two conditions: the premise is true, and the premise entails the conclusion. In this case the reasoning satisfies the first condition, but it does not satisfy the second condition. So it does not satisfy both conditions. So the reasoning is not good enough to think that the conclusion is true. So, even though the person has given you a reason for her claim, it's not a good enough reason to think that the claim is true.

# Second example

Suppose someone points out that despite it being poisonous, people often eat sodium. He reasons as follows (presented in standard form):

> People often eat salt, and salt contains sodium<br>
  Therefore,<br>
  People often eat sodium

Has he given a good enough reason to think that people often eat sodium? Let’s work through it.

We need to check two things:

- Is the premise true?
- Does the premise entail the conclusion?

First, is the premise true? Yes it is – people do often eat salt, and salt does indeed contain sodium (as you probably know, salt is sodium chloride). So the first condition is satisfied.

Second, does the premise entail the conclusion? Yes it does. If the premise is true then the conclusion *has* to be true. If it's true that people often eat salt and salt contains sodium, then it *has* to be true that people often eat sodium – there is no alternative. In other words, it’s *impossible* for it to be true that people often eat salt and salt contains sodium, and yet false that people often eat sodium. So the second condition is satisfied.

So, for this piece of reasoning both conditions are satisfied. So, the reasoning is good enough to think that the conclusion is true. So, you can go ahead and accept the conclusion – people do often eat sodium.

# Third example

Suppose someone gives you the following piece of reasoning:

> Adelaide has hosted the Olympic games<br>
  Therefore,<br>
  The Olympic games have been held in Australia

Is this reasoning good enough to think that the conclusion is true? Again, we need to check whether both conditions are satisfied. First, is the premise true? That is, is it true that Adelaide has hosted the Olympic games? No, it’s not – it’s false. So the first condition is not satisfied. This means that we don’t need to check the second condition – whether or not the second condition is satisfied, it is not the case that both conditions are satisfied, because the first condition isn't. So this reasoning is not good enough to think that the conclusion is true.

Note that the conclusion of this reasoning is actually true (the Olympic games have been held in Australia, in both Melbourne and Sydney). The fact that the reasoning doesn't satisfy both conditions doesn't mean that the conclusion is false - it just means that this piece of reasoning is not good enough to think that it's true. There might be some other piece of reasoning which *is* good enough. (In fact, there is. Can you think of one?)

# Questions

[[[ In the following exchange, A is giving a piece of reasoning. Put the reasoning into standard form. A: "Building more roads is not the solution to Sydney's traffic problems." B: "Why believe that?" A: "Because the traffic will just expand to fill the roads available.”
>>>
The traffic will just expand to fill the roads available<br>
Therefore,<br>
Building more roads is not the solution to Sydney's traffic problems
]]]

[[[ Does the following piece of reasoning have a true premise? Explain. "Sydney has a larger population than Brisbane. Therefore, buying property in Sydney is a sounder investment than buying property in Brisbane.”
>>>
The premise is that Sydney has a larger population than Brisbane, which is true.
]]]

[[[ The following piece of reasoning has a true premise, but does the premise entail the conclusion? Explain. "There are kangaroos in Nowra and Nowra is in NSW. Therefore, there are kangaroos in NSW.”
>>>
Yes. If the premise is true then the conclusion *has* to be true. That is, if it's true that there are kangaroos in Nowra and Nowra is in NSW, then it *has* to be true that there are kangaroos in NSW.
]]]

[[[ The following piece of reasoning has a true premise, but does the premise entail the conclusion? Explain. "There are kangaroos in NSW and Nowra is in NSW. Therefore, there are kangaroos in Nowra.”
>>>
No. It's possible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false. Suppose there had been kangaroos in Katoomba but not in Nowra. Then the premise would have been true (there are kangaroos in Katoomba and thus in NSW) but the conclusion would have been false (there are no kangaroos in Nowra).
]]]

[[[ Is the following piece of reasoning good enough to think that the conclusion is true? Explain. "Mercury has a moon. Therefore, some planets in our solar system have a moon.”
>>>
No. The premise is false - Mercury does not have a moon.
]]]

[[[ Is the following piece of reasoning good enough to think that the conclusion is true? Explain. "Angola is an African country and Angola is entirely in the southern hemisphere. Therefore, some African countries are entirely in the southern hemisphere.”
>>>
Yes. The premise is true (Angola is an African country and Angola is entirely in the southern hemisphere), and the premise entails the conclusion (if Angola is an African country and Angola is entirely in the southern hemisphere then it *has* to be true that some African countries are entirely in the southern hemisphere).
]]]

[[[ In the following exchange, A is giving a piece of reasoning. Put the reasoning into standard form, and then judge whether the reasoning is good enough to think that the conclusion is true (and explain why). A: "The next Australian prime minister will be right-handed." B: "Why think that?" A: "Because most Australians are right-handed.”
>>>
In standard form:

Most Australians are right-handed<br>
Therefore,<br>
The next Australian prime minister will be right-handed

The premise is true, but it does not entail the conclusion - just because most Australians are right-handed it doesn't *have* to be true that the next prime minister will be right handed.
]]]

[[[ How might you properly reason that the Olympic games have been held in Australia?
>>>
Melbourne has hosted the Olympic games<br>
Therefore,<br>
The Olympic games have been held in Australia

(You could use Sydney too.)
