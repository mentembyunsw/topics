%% Presentations: Sounding Good %%

In this topic, we will focus on how aspects of prosody can enhance the vocal delivery of your presentation. The elements of prosody that we will review include intonation, stress, tempo, rhythm and pause.

In this topic we will shift focus from the ‘what’ of your speech to the ‘how’ of its delivery.

- How your voice sounds
- The pace of your speaking
- Your volume 
- How you modulate across a vocal range 

These are all critically important to your success as a presenter. 

Audiences respond not only to what you say, but even more to how you say it. In her book, The Right to Speak, voice expert Patsy Rodenberg calls this a ‘snap judgement’. You might not be aware that it does, but your voice creates instant impressions. 

Patsy (1964, Right to Speak, p. 4) poses some relevant questions such as:

- Do we sound enfranchised or disenfranchised? 
- Educated or uneducated? 
- Hesitant or confident?

# From what to how

When you introduce yourself, do you vocalise the last syllable of your surname with an upward inflection, or a downward inflection? 

Using an upward inflection, or ‘uptalk’, is where your vocal pitch goes up at the end of a declarative sentence. It is one habit of speech that can make ordinary statements sound like questions. While it can help you to sound unthreatening, it can also make you sound unconvincing, vulnerable or ‘weak’. 

Uptalk is a habit that has even been described by experts in linguistics as being strangely local. They call it the Australian Question Intonation.

Watch this video to hear an example of uptalk in speech.

Now that you have heard an example, practice saying the following sentence out loud. 
First try to say the sentence using an upward inflection, and then try it using a downward inflection. 

> "What a beautiful day"

Now practice introducing yourself. Say your full name and where you work.  

First try using an upward inflection, and then try using a downward inflection.

# Make a strong impression

Your voice is one of the first tools you have to make a strong impression. Boring voices make great ideas sound boring too!

Did you know that before Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, she underwent significant vocal training? Advisors not only changed Thatcher’s physical appearance (she wore more masculine clothes with large shoulder pads), they also lowered the pitch of her voice by 46 hertz. That is half the difference between an average male and female voice.    

Watch this video to see how Thatcher’s transformation from a ’feminised’ shrill voice to a more diaphragmatic voice (i.e., a voice with lower pitch and greater timbre) increased her authority and helped her live up to her name as the ‘Iron Lady’.

The ‘how’ of vocal delivery is called the ‘prosody’ of speech. Prosody describes the patterns of rhythm and sound in speech, in terms of the following dynamics:

- **Register**: Depth of voice
- **Timbre**: Warmth, richness or smoothness of voice
- **Prosody**: Sound variation and vocal range – sing-song like vs monotone, as well as rhythm, including pauses
- **Pace**: Speed or slowness or variations between
- **Volume**: Loudness or softness or modulations between

There are many ways to analyse the prosody of speech and it varies from language to language. A great way to improve your speaking is to tune into the prosody of speech and listen closely to how other speakers perform.

# Watch and think

Consider how the following graduation speeches from Barack Obama and Megan Markle demonstrate choices in working with the prosody. 

# Example 1: Barack Obama

This first example is a speech which Barack Obama gave at Howard University in 2016. Watch the video from the beginning up to 3:13. Listen once to Obama's speech and see if you can notice the way that he uses register, timbre, prosody, pace and volume. Make some notes of where you hear pronounced uses of these features.

# Listen again to Obama 

Now listen to Obama's speech a second time. This time, as you listen read the following transcript which includes "stage directions" for prosody in his speech. See if you can hear the changes in Obama's voice as indicated by these "stage directions". 

> To President Frederick **[pause]**, the Board of Trustees **[pause]**, faculty and staff, **[long pause]** fellow recipients of honorary degrees, **[pause]** thank you for the honor of spending this day with you **[rising inflection]**. And congratulations to the Class of 2016! **[increased volume / rising inflection]** Four years ago, back when you were just freshmen, I understand many of you came by my house the night I was reelected. **[brief pause]** So I decided to return the favor and come by yours. **[faster pace / builds momentum]**

> To the parents, **[pause]** the grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, all the family and friends who stood by this class, cheered them on, helped them get here today **[downwards inflection]** -- this is your day, as well. Let’s give them a big round of applause, as well. **[pause]** I’m not trying to stir up any rivalries here; I just want to see who’s in the house. We got Quad? **[pause]** Annex. **[pause]** Drew. **[increasing volume]** Carver. Slow. Towers. And Meridian. **[downward inflection]** Rest in peace, Meridian. **[pause]** Rest in peace.

> I know you’re all excited today. **[downward inflection]** You might be a little tired, as well. Some of you were up all night making sure your credits were in order. **[pause]** Some of you stayed up too late, ended up at HoChi at 2:00 a.m. **[pause]** Got some mambo sauce on your fingers.**[pause/rising inflection]**

> But you got here. And you've all worked hard to reach **[emphasis]** this day. You’ve shuttled between challenging classes and Greek life. You've led clubs, played an instrument or a sport. You volunteered, you interned. You held down one, two, maybe three jobs. You've made lifelong friends and discovered exactly what you’re made of. The “Howard Hustle” **[emphasis]** has strengthened your sense of purpose and ambition.

**Analysis of Obama's speech**

This light-hearted and congratulatory tone from Obama employs more rising inflection than would normally be used in formal or combative political contexts. Why? Because here, Obama wants to seem ‘familiar’, ‘down with it’ and on the same level as his young audience. 

Note how responsive he is to applause. He waits and pauses for applause. This rhythm builds suspense and also shows he is reading the room as he is speaking – it builds ethos, or credibility. And because the audience senses his responsiveness, they feel ‘safe’ with him commanding the stage. While pausing does create suspense, too much of it can also make listeners tune out. 

Obama modifies pausing with variations in pace (increasing as well as slowing down). Variations in rhythm are what keeps listeners listening for what’s next, as does his exceptionally warm and resonant ‘diaphragmatic’ voice, which rises and falls melodically. Obama strikes the perfect balance between seeming presidential and seeming playful, warm and fun.

# Example 2: Megan Markle

This next example is a speech which Megan Markle speaks to Immaculate Heart High School in 2020. Watch the video from the beginning up to 6:08. Listen once to Megan's speech and see if you can notice the way that she uses register, timbre, prosody, pace and volume. Make some notes of where you hear pronounced uses of these features.

# Listen again to Megan 

Now listen to Megan's speech a second time. This time, as you listen read the following transcript which includes "stage directions" for prosody in her speech. See if you can hear the changes in Megan's voice as indicated by these "stage directions". 

> Immaculate Heart High School, **[brief pause]** graduating class of 2020 **[long pause]**. For the past couple of weeks, I’ve been planning on saying **[pause]** a few words to you for your graduation. **[voice downward inflection]** As we’ve all seen over the last week, what is happening in our country, **[brief pause]** and in our state, **[pause]** and in our hometown of LA, **[longer pause, eyes downwards]** has been absolutely devastating. **[voice downward inflection]** um **[filler, eyes downwards, shoulders moving back]** I wasn’t sure what I could say to you **[speeding up]**. I wanted to say the right thing and I was really nervous that I wouldn’t or that it would get picked apart. I realized **[pause]** the only wrong thing to say is to say nothing **[downward inflection, pause]** because **[speeding up]** George Floyd’s life mattered, and Breonna Taylor’s life mattered, and Philando Castile’s life mattered, and Tamir Rice’s life mattered. **[pause]** And so did so many other people whose names we know and whose names we do not know. **[downward inflection / speeding up]** Stefan Clark, his life mattered.

**Analysis of Megan's speech**

Megan Markle is presenting a pre-recorded speech that is designed to feel familiar and warm. A key difference from Obama’s speech is that Markle has to work much harder to show that she is responding to how her audience might be feeling – as they are not really there! Markle’s pauses are very strategic (she is a trained actor after all!) as is her body language (which we look at in the next modules). While Obama’s tone was largely jovial, Markle begins on a more sombre note, and this is reflected in her downward inflections as well as the increasing pace with which she delivers key sections. Notice how Markle’s downward inflections give her credibility and authority – and ‘de-feminise’ her, whereas Obama’s upward inflections do the opposite.

# Reflection

Think about your own presentation and speaking style and consider the following questions: 

- How can you employ strategic pauses in your presentations, either to indicate time for reflection or for emphasis?
- When would it be important to use rising inflection in order to communicate warmth and vulnerability?
- What would it be important to use downward inflections in order to communicate strength and authority?
- How could you vary your speaking pace from slow, so as to focus in on key issues, to fast, so as to create momentum and excitement?

As you progress the preparation of your presentation, consider marking it up like a script with stage directions that address the questions above. Then, you’ll need to practice and practice just like a seasoned actor or president!
