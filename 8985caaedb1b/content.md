%% Presentations: Memorable Speech %%

In this topic, we will focus on the characteristics of text that is written for oral communication and how it can be tailored to make speeches that are hearable and memorable.

# Orality

Think of the way that a nursery rhyme sticks in your head. Or a piece of verse such as a song, a prayer or a chant. You might find that it stays with you or is memorable. Language that is written to be spoken has different formal qualities and involves different textual techniques from those you might employ when writing for other contexts.

**The origin of orality**

'Orality' comes from what north American historian Walter Ong has called traditional ‘oral’ cultures. 'Oral' cultures are those that communicate without the printed word. In other words, speaking, listening and telling stories form the primary means of sharing knowledge. 

**Words that are meant to be spoken**

‘Orality’ is a concept that describes words that are written to be spoken, and hence words that are written to be heard, listened to and remembered. 

**Auditory conditions**

'Orality' is connected to the auditory conditions of your audience: what, and how, they hear.

# Be heard easily and remembered readily

But the history of orality does not just remain in the past. Understanding the ways that people communicated before print is crucial to the choices you make when writing your own presentations.

This is because you want your words to be heard easily and remembered readily.

> In a primary oral culture, to solve effectively the problem of retaining and retrieving carefully articulated thought, you have to do your thinking in mnemonic patterns, shaped for ready oral recurrence. Your thought must come into being in heavily rhythmic, balanced patterns, in repetitions or antitheses, in alliterations and assonances, in epithetic and other formulary expressions, in standard thematic settings (the assembly, the meal, the duel, the hero’s ‘helper’, and so on), in proverbs which are constantly heard by everyone so that they come to mind readily and which themselves are patterned for retention and ready recall, or in other mnemonic form. (Walter Ong, Orality and Literacy 1982: 34)

Writing language that is designed to be spoken is different from writing a report, an analysis or an article. The objective of orality is to facilitate recall and recognition, to make stories easy to remember, and to make speeches easy to listen to and to report upon. And this applies to any speech, whatever the occasion, whether it is formal and serious, or light-hearted and enjoyable.

## Breaking down Ong's formula

The techniques that Ong describes might seem strange but they are more familiar than you might realise. Now that you know, you will notice that they are used all the time in the world of advertising. 

Review these three advertising campaigns to see how alliteration, assonance and rhythm are used in product slogans. 

**1. Alliteration: Snickers satisfies**

Alliteration is the connection of words beginning with the same letter sound.  Watch this Snickers commercial to see how the brand used alliteration in the slogan "Snickers satisfies".

**2. Assonance: Beanz Meanz Heinz** 

Assonance is the use of resemblance in word or syllable vowel sounds. Watch this Heinz commercial to see how the brand used assonance in the slogan "Beanz Meanz Heinz".

**3. Rhythmically based sentence: Have a break, have a KitKat**

Rhythmically balanced sentences, which may include repetition, are an excellent oration device. Watch this KitKat commercial to see how the brand has used rhythm in the slogan "Have a break, have a KitKat".

Catchy slogans help the words roll off our tongues and cue us to remember that the solution to our problem is just a few words (and a purchase) away. 

Read each of the following slogans and decide which of the three orality techniques was used. Then, reveal the answer to see if you were right. 

Is the slogan an example of **rhyme**, **alliteration** or **assonance**?

[[[ Gillette - the best a man can get >>>
This Gillette slogan uses **rhyme** with the words "best" and "get".
]]]

[[[ That calls for a Carlsberg >>>
This Carlsberg slogan **alliterates** by using the words "calls" and "Carlsberg" that both begin with the letter "c".
]]]

[[[ Compare the market vs compare the meerkat >>>
This Compare the Market slogan uses **assonance** of the individual words "market" and "meerkat". Thesewords are phonetically identical except for a single phoneme. 
]]]

[[[ Fluent in finance (Barclays Bank) >>>
This Barclays Bank slogan **alliterates** by using the words "fluent" and "finance" that both begin with the letter "f".
]]]

[[[ Put a tiger in your tank (Esso) >>>
This Esso slogan **alliterates** by using the words "tiger" and "tank" that both begin with the letter "t".
]]]

]]]

[[[ Make the most of now (Vodafone) >>>

]]]

[[[ Freshen-up with 7-Up >>>
This 7-up slogan uses **rhyme** with the phrases "Freshen-up" and "seven-up".

# How dare you!

It's not just advertisers who can master the techniques of orality. Kids can do it too! Watch the first two minutes from Greta Thunberg’s 2019 address to the U.N.'s Climate Action Summit in New York City and see if you can detect techniques of orality used in the first two minutes of the speech.

After you have watched the video, reveal and review some possible examples of alliteration and rhythm or repetition that you may have identified.

[[[ Possible examples of alliteration that you may have identified >>>
- We’ll be watching you
- eternal economic growth
- understood the situation and still
- crystal clear
- entire ecosystems
]]]

[[[ Possible examples of rhythm that you may have identified >>>
- This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here
- You have stolen my dreams and my childhood 
- with your empty words
]]]

[[[ Possible examples of repetition that you may have identified >>>
- How dare you!
- People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing.

# Over to you: Making boring topics fun

Your job as a presenter is to convey information in the most digestible and appealing format as possible. In a business context, this will often involve making boring topics fun. Playing with words and finding zinger catchphrases is one way to help you distil your project aims as well as convey them in a bite-sized, digestible and memorable format.

For instance, Snickers don’t say "When you are hungry, Snickers is a great solution because it will fill you with nutritional value and a high carb loading as it has chocolate as well as nuts.""

They say "Snickers Satisfies", and then, they might go on to explain why.

Now it’s your turn to brainstorm some approaches that draw on techniques in orality – and feel free to be playful here.

# 1. Start simple

List all of the keywords – technical and other – that are currently focussed in your project approach. 

Then, connect back to Module 2: TUNING IN – what did you record as your presentation aims?

Check what you wrote for the following provocations:

- I want my audience to understand ....
- I want my audience to feel ....
- I want my audience to do ....

# 2. Span out! 

Keeping those aims in mind, span out around your keywords – brainstorm words that rhyme, sound good, alliterate or create balanced rhythms. Find metaphors that convey the change that your vision aims to bring. Avoid jargon and tricky or alienating words. Find images that communicate simply what you want to achieve.

# 3. Focus it! 

Now it’s your turn to come up with a presentation catchphrase or slogan. Again, it is fine to be playful at this point. You might not end up using it – but it can anchor how you approach the persuasiveness of your speech by clarifying your ideas in a condensed and catchy format.
