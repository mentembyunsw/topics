%% The decision making process %%

# What a decision involves

Suppose you have a decision to make, perhaps about something at work, or about something in your personal life.

This means you have some options, and you need to choose one of them. Making a decision is a matter of choosing one from among several options.

Sometimes the options are given to you. If you're deciding which day of the week to hold a meeting, then your options are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. Sometimes they're not. If you're deciding what to do about the growing rate of employee churn in your business, then the options are open, and part of your task is to identify them. 

Ideally, when you choose an option, you don't just choose at random. Rather, you choose it by carefully weighing the pros and cons of each option. That involves identifying those pros and cons, and evaluating how they compare.

So, to make a decision, you need to do the following three things:

1. Identify the options, if they're not given to you.
2. Identify the pros and cons of each option.
3. Choose one of the options, by weighing their pros and cons.

# Using a group

If a decision is small and fairly insignificant, then you can reasonably well make it by yourself. But for large or significant decisions, it is good to get help from others. If you're making an important decision at work, you'll likely do it with the help of a group of people - a committee, or a project team.

Having a group of people can help with each of the three decision-making steps.

First, it can help when identifying the options (if they're not given to you). It can be hard to come up with a comprehensive list by yourself - we have limited imaginations, and we tend to get set in our thinking. It can help to have a variety of imaginations and ways of thinking.

Second, it can help when identifying the pros and cons of each option. Each of us has limited knowledge and experience, and thus limited ability to identify the effects of each option, and the extent to which they are good or bad. It can help to have a group of people with diverse knowledge and experience.

Third, it can help when choosing one of the options. Rather than make the choice by yourself, you can get everyone in the group to make their own choice, and then combine the individual choices into a final overall choice. Essentially, take a vote. Done in the right way, a vote can yield a better outcome than choosing one of the options by yourself.

In the following TED talk, Tom Wujec describes some of the advantages of working in a group (it's not specific to decision making):

# Forming a group

If you're using a group to help make a decision, who should be in the group?

Often you have no choice - the group is given to you. This is typically the case at work.

If you do have a choice, you should try to include whoever will be most helpful during the steps of the decision making process. Different skills are required at each stage, and it's a good idea to choose accordingly:

- **Helping to identify the options**. You want people who think creatively and in diverse ways.

- **Helping to identify their pros and cons**. You want people who each have unique knowledge and experience to contribute: ideally, each person should know something relevant, or have experienced something relevant, that no one else in the group knows or has experienced. You also want people who can clearly and logically think through the consequences of the options.

- **Helping to choose an option by weighing the pros and cons**. If you're getting the group to help choose an option, by taking a vote, then you want people who can weigh the pros and cons of the options to make a sensible choice.

In addition, you want people who have good communication skills - who can express themselves clearly, and listen well. And you want people who have good emotional intelligence - who can read the emotions of others. These skills help people work effectively in a group of any kind.

# Managing a group

A group of people will not automatically function well together, and it needs to be managed.

It can be a good idea to assign people to specific roles. Typical roles include:

- **Facilitator**: someone to organise the group.

- **Time keeper**: someone to make sure that group activities take a sensible amount of time - not too much, not too little. The time keeper should be alert to the danger of discussing small issues for a long time, and big issues for a little time (people sometimes refer to a "law of triviality", according to which the time spent on a task tends to be inversely proportional to its importance). The time keeper should also be alert to the danger of group procrastination - using discussion to avoid real work.

- **Process watcher**: someone to monitor the processes being used, to make sure that everyone gets an opportunity to speak, that no one person is dominating, and so on.

- **Note taker**: someone to record what happens.

It's also important to foster the right kind of atmosphere in the group. You want everyone to feel safe to voice their opinion, without fear of judgment or consequence. All discussions should be conducted respectfully, especially when they involve disagreement.
